   * Sorting by frequency_qualifier is a special case. Those terms are entities

   * represent the frequency of a phenotypic association. The other two are a
   * ratio and a percentage. To sort all three values at the same time, we have
   * a derived column in the index that unifies all of these representation
   * called `frequency_computed_sortable_float`.
   *
   * This replacement could be done on /any/ frequency key (has_percentage,
   * has_count, has_total), but for now, we only use frequency qualifier in the
   * table.
   *
   * This could end up being a bug if someone /actually/, /really/ wanted to
   * only sort by the frequency qualifier, and have the other two classes show
   * up as null.
