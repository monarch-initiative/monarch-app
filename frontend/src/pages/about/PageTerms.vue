      pledges to never inspect or disclose any private, identifying information
      collected, and to only use it for the purposes of improving Monarch. To

    <AppHeading>Variant interpretation</AppHeading>
    <p>
      The Monarch Initiative sources variant interpretations as provided by the
      original source, with no consolidation of results, and always has a link
      out to the original reference. While we display the variants and
      interpretations as originally reported in the variant databases, some
      variants in the same genes have been reported on different transcripts.
      Whenever possible, Monarch will attempt to map all variants in a
      particular gene to a common transcript to aid in viewing and organizing
      the variants. However, to aid in variant searches, we will also continue
      to report the original mapping information. All interpretations were
      performed by the original submitters and have not been modified in any
      way. As such, there might be discordant interpretations for the same
      variant from different archives. For further information or to request a
      review of the variant, please contact the submitter of the original
      reference. Variant interpretations are not static as they are based on the
      current understanding of the variant at the time it was observed in a
      patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation may not be
      up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many interpretations
      will change over time as more information about the variant becomes
      available. If you have any questions about a variant interpretation or
      would like use any variant interpretations for publication purposes,
      please contact the submitter of the original reference. As always, we
      value your feedback. Please email us if you have any problems, concerns,
      or suggestions.
